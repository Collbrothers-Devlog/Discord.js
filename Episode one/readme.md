# Episode 1

### Stuff we went through in this episode:

```
Downloading Nodejs, NPM and Visual Studio Code
Basic NPM, Nodejs commands
Creating a new discord Application and adding a bot to it
Inviting the bot to a server
Introduction to EventListeners (Discord.js Client)
Logging on ready, and message event
Setting a presence
Replying and send messages to a channel when a specific prefix and command has been sent
Some basics about MessageEmbeds methods
Login/start the client
```

### Stuff to keep in mind:

```
Try to keep the presence updating in the ready event, else you could get ratelimited
A field in a MessageEmbed requires both a name and a value: embed.addField("name","value")
Try to keep the main entry point named index.js
Try to keep the variable names consistent with the value it holds
The bot token is like a password for the bot; Do not share it with people!
To run a JS file, type: node <Filename, or .>
To install a package, simply type: npm <i or install> <packageName>
```
